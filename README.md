# WHF_Sawmill
Our edited version of the sawmill 

The F1 menu screen is translated in to English, however the working screens are not. It would be good to have it all in English so we don't always need to have the F1 screen open to view what's needed. 

I've found a few lines in fabrikscript.lua that alter the F1 screen, but I've not had time to read through everything to find the screen. I believe it's in this file though.
